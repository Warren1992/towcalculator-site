    <h1>How to Weigh Your Truck + Trailer at a CAT Scale (Step-by-Step)</h1>

    <p>
      If you want to know whether your towing setup is actually safe, a real weigh-in beats any spreadsheet,
      brochure, or guess.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news: weighing a tow vehicle and trailer is simple if you do it in the right order.
      This guide walks you through exactly what to weigh and how to interpret the numbers.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Why this matters:</strong><br>
      Most “it tows fine” setups are overloaded on payload or rear axle long before they hit tow rating.
      A scale makes the truth obvious.
    </div>

    <h2>What You Need Before You Go</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Your vehicle’s door sticker payload and GVWR</li>
      <li>Rear axle rating (RAWR) / GAWR (on sticker or manual)</li>
      <li>Trailer GVWR (on trailer sticker)</li>
      <li>Your rig loaded like a real trip (passengers, gear, full hitch hardware)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ideally, load your trailer the way you actually travel: propane, batteries, water (if you carry it),
      and your normal cargo.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Definitions (So the Ticket Makes Sense)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>GVWR</strong>: max weight of the tow vehicle itself</li>
      <li><strong>GAWR / RAWR</strong>: max weight on each axle (rear axle is the usual failure point)</li>
      <li><strong>GCWR</strong>: max combined weight of vehicle + trailer (if you have it)</li>
      <li><strong>Payload</strong>: how much weight you can add to the vehicle (people + cargo + hitch + tongue/pin)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Best Weighing Method: 3 Passes</h2>

    <p>
      Three passes gives you the cleanest answers:
      (1) vehicle alone, (2) hitched without weight distribution engaged, (3) hitched with weight distribution engaged (if you use it).
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Important:</strong><br>
      A weight distribution hitch can move weight between axles, but it does <em>not</em> make payload disappear.
      Hitch hardware weight still counts.
    </div>

    <h2>Pass #1 — Tow Vehicle Only (Baseline)</h2>

    <p>
      Drive onto the scale with just the tow vehicle (no trailer).
      If possible, load the vehicle with the same people and cargo you’ll have when towing.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Record front axle weight</li>
      <li>Record rear axle weight</li>
      <li>Record total vehicle weight</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is your baseline and makes the rest of the math simple.
    </p>

    <h2>Pass #2 — Hitched, WDH Not Engaged (If You Have One)</h2>

    <p>
      Hook up the trailer exactly how you tow it, but if you use a weight distribution hitch (WDH),
      do this pass with the bars/chains not tensioned (or “not engaged”).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Front axle weight (vehicle)</li>
      <li>Rear axle weight (vehicle)</li>
      <li>Trailer axle weight(s)</li>
      <li>Total combined weight</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This pass is the easiest way to see how much the hitch load shifts weight to the rear axle.
    </p>

    <h2>Pass #3 — Hitched, WDH Engaged (If You Use It)</h2>

    <p>
      Now engage your WDH as you normally would and weigh again.
      You’ll see weight move off the rear axle and back toward the front axle and trailer axles.
    </p>

    <p>
      This pass answers: “Is my WDH adjustment helping axle balance?”
      (It still doesn’t change your payload limit, but it can improve handling and stability.)
    </p>

    <h2>How to Read the Results</h2>

    <p>
      Here are the key checks most people care about:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vehicle GVWR check:</strong> your hitched vehicle total (front + rear) should be ≤ GVWR</li>
      <li><strong>Rear axle check:</strong> rear axle should be ≤ RAWR/GAWR (this is the common one to fail)</li>
      <li><strong>Trailer check:</strong> trailer axle total should be ≤ trailer GVWR (and tire ratings)</li>
      <li><strong>Combined check:</strong> combined total should be ≤ GCWR (if you have it)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Payload shortcut:</strong><br>
      Payload used ≈ (hitched vehicle total) − (vehicle-only total).<br>
      That “difference” includes tongue/pin weight + hitch hardware + anything you added for the trip.
    </div>

    <h2>What About Tongue Weight?</h2>

    <p>
      A simple estimate you can use:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Travel trailers: ~12–15% of loaded trailer weight on the hitch</li>
      <li>Car trailers: ~10–15% (varies by load position)</li>
      <li>5th wheels/goosenecks: often ~15–25% pin weight</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The scale is the reality check. If your rear axle or payload margin is tight, tongue/pin weight is usually why.
    </p>

    <h2>If You’re Over: The Most Effective Fixes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Reduce tongue weight by moving cargo rearward in the trailer (carefully—maintain stability)</li>
      <li>Remove cargo from the tow vehicle (payload is precious)</li>
      <li>Carry less water/gear when possible</li>
      <li>Upgrade tow vehicle (more payload is the real game-changer)</li>
    </ul>

      Scale weights are the most reliable way to validate your real setup.
