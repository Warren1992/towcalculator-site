    <h1>Weight Distribution Hitch Setup: What It Fixes (And What It Doesn’t)</h1>

    <p>
      A weight distribution hitch (WDH) can make a travel trailer feel dramatically more stable —
      and it can make your tow vehicle sit level again.
    </p>

    <p>
      But a WDH is also one of the most misunderstood towing tools. This guide explains what it actually does,
      what it cannot do, and a simple setup checklist that works for most rigs.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Key truth:</strong><br>
      A WDH can improve axle balance and handling.<br>
      It does <em>not</em> increase payload, GVWR, GCWR, or your tow rating.
    </div>

    <h2>What a WDH Actually Does</h2>

    <p>
      Without a WDH, the trailer’s tongue weight acts like a lever on the rear of the tow vehicle:
      the rear squats, the front gets lighter, and steering + braking can feel worse.
    </p>

    <p>
      A WDH uses spring bars to push down on the trailer frame and “distribute” some of that load:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>It moves some weight <strong>forward</strong> onto the tow vehicle’s front axle</li>
      <li>It moves some weight <strong>rearward</strong> onto the trailer axles</li>
      <li>It reduces rear squat and improves stability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What a WDH Does NOT Do</h2>

    <p>
      These myths get people into trouble:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “WDH increases payload.”<br><strong>Reality:</strong> Tongue weight still counts against payload.</li>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “WDH increases tow rating.”<br><strong>Reality:</strong> Ratings don’t change.</li>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “If the truck is level, I’m safe.”<br><strong>Reality:</strong> You can be level and still overloaded on axle/payload.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Important:</strong><br>
      Hitch hardware weight (WDH head + bars) is extra weight on the vehicle and counts toward payload.
      That’s why “payload-first” towing still matters even with a WDH.
    </div>

    <h2>When You Should Use a WDH</h2>

    <p>
      A WDH is commonly recommended when:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Travel trailer tongue weight is substantial (often > ~500 lb, depending on vehicle)</li>
      <li>Your rear squat is significant or steering feels light</li>
      <li>Your manufacturer requires WDH above certain trailer weights</li>
      <li>You want better stability at highway speed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It’s less common for car trailers, but can still apply if tongue weight is high and the tow vehicle is near limits.
    </p>

    <h2>Simple Setup Checklist (The “Good Enough” Method)</h2>

    <p>
      This is a practical setup workflow that gets most people in the right zone:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Park on level ground.</strong> Load the vehicle and trailer like a real trip.</li>
      <li><strong>Measure tow vehicle height:</strong> front and rear fender height (baseline).</li>
      <li><strong>Hitch up without engaging the bars</strong> (or minimal tension) and measure again.</li>
      <li><strong>Engage the bars</strong> and adjust tension until the front end is close to baseline height.</li>
      <li><strong>Confirm your setup at a scale</strong> if you can (best practice).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      A common goal is to restore the front axle close to its unhitched height — not necessarily perfectly level.
    </p>

    <h2>The Scale Test (Best Practice)</h2>

    <p>
      If you want to know whether your WDH is doing what you think it is, weigh:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hitched with WDH <strong>not engaged</strong> (or minimal tension)</li>
      <li>Hitched with WDH <strong>engaged</strong> as you tow</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You should see some weight shift off the rear axle and onto the front/trailer axles.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Safety check:</strong><br>
      Even with a WDH, your rear axle and payload can still be the limiting factor.
      Stability improvements don’t erase ratings.
    </div>

    <h2>Common Mistakes That Make Towing Worse</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Too little tension:</strong> rear still squats, front stays light</li>
      <li><strong>Too much tension:</strong> can overload trailer frame/axles or make ride harsh</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring payload:</strong> WDH hardware + tongue weight can exceed payload fast</li>
      <li><strong>Poor loading:</strong> too little tongue weight can cause sway (dangerous)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How This Fits Into Payload-First Towing</h2>

    <p>
      Think of a WDH as a handling and balance tool. The “can I tow this?” question still starts with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Payload remaining after tongue weight + people + cargo + hitch hardware</li>
      <li>Rear axle weight vs RAWR/GAWR</li>
      <li>Trailer loaded weight and stability</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="cta">
      <strong>Estimate your payload + tongue weight first</strong>
      <p>Use the calculator to see how tongue weight and hitch hardware affect payload — then verify at a scale.</p>
