    <h1>Trailer Sway: Why It Happens (And How to Fix It Safely)</h1>

    <p>
      Trailer sway is one of the scariest towing problems because it can go from “a little wiggle”
      to “I’m losing control” fast.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news: most sway is preventable. It’s usually a <strong>loading</strong> and <strong>setup</strong> issue —
      not a “my tow rating is too low” issue.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>High-level rule:</strong><br>
      Stable towing comes from correct <strong>tongue weight</strong>, proper loading, good tires, and the right hitch setup.
      Tow rating alone won’t protect you from sway.
    </div>

    <h2>What Trailer Sway Actually Is</h2>

    <p>
      Sway is an oscillation: the trailer starts steering itself left/right behind the tow vehicle.
      If it builds, it can push the tow vehicle around and overload your ability to correct.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sway usually starts when something disturbs the trailer:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a gust of wind</li>
      <li>a passing truck</li>
      <li>uneven pavement</li>
      <li>speed too high for the setup</li>
      <li>steering corrections that “feed” the oscillation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The #1 Cause: Not Enough Tongue Weight</h2>

    <p>
      A trailer needs enough weight on the hitch to stay pointed straight.
      If tongue weight is too low, the trailer becomes “tail heavy” and wants to wag.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Typical tongue weight targets:</strong><br>
      Travel trailers: often ~12–15% of loaded trailer weight (general rule-of-thumb).<br>
      Too low is the danger zone for sway.
    </div>

    <p>
      If you load heavy items behind the trailer axles, you reduce tongue weight and increase sway risk.
      If you load heavy items forward of the axles, tongue weight goes up (more stable) —
      but it can also eat payload fast.
    </p>

    <h2>Other Common Causes of Sway</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trailer is overloaded</strong> (or loaded unevenly)</li>
      <li><strong>Soft or underinflated tires</strong> on the trailer or tow vehicle</li>
      <li><strong>Worn suspension</strong> (rear squat, weak shocks)</li>
      <li><strong>Too much speed</strong> for the wheelbase/trailer length combo</li>
      <li><strong>Incorrect hitch setup</strong> (WDH/sway control not set up correctly)</li>
      <li><strong>Crosswinds</strong> with a tall/boxy trailer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What To Do If Sway Starts</h2>

    <div class="danger">
      <strong>Safety note:</strong> This is general information — always follow your owner’s manual and local laws.
      If you feel unsafe, slow down and find a safe place to pull over.
    </div>

    <p>
      If you feel sway building, the main goal is to <strong>stop feeding it</strong> and reduce the forces causing it.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hold the wheel steady.</strong> Avoid rapid back-and-forth steering.</li>
      <li><strong>Ease off the throttle.</strong> Let speed bleed off gradually.</li>
      <li><strong>Do not panic-brake.</strong> Hard braking can make sway worse.</li>
      <li><strong>If your trailer has a brake controller:</strong> applying trailer brakes (gently) can help straighten the trailer.</li>
      <li><strong>Get to a safe stop</strong> and re-check loading, tongue weight, and tire pressure.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Most effective sway fix:</strong><br>
      Slower speed + correct tongue weight + proper loading.
    </div>

    <h2>How To Prevent Sway Before It Happens</h2>

    <h2>1) Load for Stability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Put heavy gear <strong>low and near the trailer axles</strong> (not behind them).</li>
      <li>Avoid “tail heavy” loading (rear storage packed with dense items).</li>
      <li>Secure cargo so it can’t shift while driving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Get Tongue Weight Into the Right Range</h2>
    <p>
      Measure, don’t guess. People are often surprised how their loading changes tongue weight.
      Even moving a generator, cooler, or water can shift things a lot.
    </p>

    <h2>3) Tire Pressure and Tire Type Matter</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Inflate tow vehicle tires and trailer tires to appropriate pressure for the load.</li>
      <li>Underinflated tires flex more, which can amplify sway.</li>
      <li>Old/worn trailer tires can behave unpredictably under load.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Use the Right Hitch Setup</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>weight distribution hitch (WDH)</strong> can help stability for many travel trailers.</li>
      <li><strong>Sway control</strong> devices can help — but they are not a substitute for correct loading.</li>
      <li>A “level” tow vehicle does not automatically mean you’re within payload/axle limits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Respect Speed and Conditions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Slower speeds dramatically reduce sway risk.</li>
      <li>Crosswinds and passing trucks are real — slow down and leave space.</li>
      <li>Short wheelbase vehicles generally feel sway sooner than long wheelbase trucks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where Payload-First Fits In</h2>

    <p>
      Fixing sway often means increasing tongue weight — which improves stability —
      but tongue weight comes out of <strong>payload</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s why “tow rating is fine” can still end badly: you can get stable tongue weight
      and still exceed payload or rear axle limits.
    </p>

      If sway is severe or repeated, stop towing and correct the setup before continuing.
