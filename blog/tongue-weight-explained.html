    <h1>Tongue Weight Explained (And Why It Destroys Payload Fast)</h1>

    <p>
      If you’ve ever checked your vehicle’s tow rating and thought,
      “I’m under the limit — I should be fine,” you’re not alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, this is where a huge number of real-world towing setups go wrong.
      The problem usually isn’t the tow rating. It’s <strong>tongue weight</strong> —
      and how fast it eats your available payload.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is Tongue Weight?</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Tongue weight</strong> is the downward force the trailer puts on your vehicle
      through the hitch.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Travel trailers: tongue weight</li>
      <li>5th wheels / goosenecks: pin weight</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This weight is carried by the tow vehicle — not the trailer axles —
      which means it counts directly against your vehicle’s <strong>payload</strong>,
      and it also affects rear axle load and GVWR.
    </p>

    <h2>The 10–15% Rule (And Why It Matters)</h2>

    <p>
      For most bumper-pull travel trailers, a stable setup usually requires
      about <strong>10–15%</strong> of the trailer’s total weight on the hitch.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Quick example:</strong><br>
      A 6,000 lb loaded travel trailer typically means ~600–900 lb of tongue weight.
    </div>

    <p>
      That number is where payload disappears fast — because tongue weight isn’t “free.”
      It’s weight your vehicle must carry.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Tongue Weight Destroys Payload So Fast</h2>

    <p>
      Let’s say your vehicle has <strong>1,500 lb</strong> of payload.
      Now add real life:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Driver + passengers: ~400 lb</li>
      <li>Cargo, tools, cooler, gear: ~200 lb</li>
      <li>Hitch + accessories: ~75 lb</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That’s already ~675 lb used — leaving ~825 lb.
      Add ~700 lb of tongue weight and you’re down to ~125 lb of margin
      (and that’s before bikes, firewood, water, or extra gear).
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>This is why people say “it tows fine” while still being overloaded.</strong><br>
      Tow rating can look great on paper, but payload is the hard limit.
    </div>

    <h2>Brochure Trailer Weights Make This Worse</h2>

    <p>
      Trailer brochures usually show <strong>dry weight</strong> and “empty” tongue weight.
      But nobody tows a trailer empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you add propane, batteries, water, and gear, tongue weight often climbs
      faster than people expect — especially when added weight sits forward of the axles.
    </p>

    <h2>Does a Weight Distribution Hitch Reduce Tongue Weight?</h2>

    <p>
      A <strong>weight distribution hitch (WDH)</strong> can improve stability by redistributing
      some load between axles, but it does <strong>not</strong> remove tongue weight from your setup.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tongue weight still counts against payload</li>
      <li>Tongue weight still counts toward GVWR</li>
      <li>WD hitches often add ~60–100 lb of their own weight</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Estimate Realistic Tongue Weight</h2>

    <p>
      If you don’t have a scale yet, use a conservative estimate:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Start with <strong>12–13%</strong> of expected loaded trailer weight</li>
      <li>Add hitch hardware</li>
      <li>Consider propane + batteries (often mounted forward)</li>
      <li>Round up if you’re unsure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Then compare against your payload rating and leave margin.
      “Close enough” is where most towing problems begin.
    </p>

    <h2>The Safer Way to Check a Setup</h2>

    <p>
      Instead of starting with tow rating, start with payload and work backward:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Estimate realistic tongue weight</li>
      <li>Add passengers + cargo + hitch hardware</li>
      <li>Check payload remaining and margins</li>
      <li>Verify with a scale when possible</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="cta">
      <strong>Check your tongue weight & payload margin</strong>
      <p>Use the payload-first towing calculator to estimate tongue/pin weight and your remaining payload.</p>
      <a href="../">Use the Towing Calculator</a>
    </div>

    <p>
      If there’s one number to respect more than tow rating, it’s tongue weight.
      It’s silent, it adds up fast, and it’s the reason many “within limits” setups
      aren’t actually within limits at all.
